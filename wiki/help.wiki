#HTTP Monitor (httpmon) Help

Setting up httpmon is quite simple once you understand the structure of objects. Here it is in outline form,

  * Monitor
    * Request
      * Interval
      * URL
      * 0 or more HTTP parameters
    * Conditions (0 or more)
    * Actions

That is, a Monitor consists of a Request, Conditions, and Actions. The Request describes how to attempt a connection to the server. Conditions are criteria that determine that state of the server. Actions are steps to perform based on the state of the server.

A Request is a URL and 0 or more HTTP parameters. Httpmon will perform an HTTP GET every Interval to test the state of the server. 

Conditions are rules, or criteria that must evaluate to true for the server to be considered in a valid state. For example,

  * ping (i.e., any response)  
  * response received in ___ or less milliseconds
  * HTTP response code is ___
  * HTTP header ___ matches ___
  * content matches ___

Conditions are logically ANDed together; the server is in a valid state if all of the conditions evaluate to true.

Actions are steps to perform based on the derived state of the server. For example,

  * if state is ___, send SMS to ___
  * if state is ___, send email to ___
  * if state is ___, send notification

Usually, you will perform actions when the server state is invalid.
