#HTTP Monitor (httpmon) Help

Setting up httpmon is quite simple once you understand the structure of objects. Here it is in outline form,

  * Monitor
    * Request
      * 0 or more HTTP parameters
    * Response
      * 0 or more rules

That is, a Monitor consists of a Request and a Response. The Request describes how to attempt a connection to the server. A Response describes what to expect in return in order to consider the server valid.
